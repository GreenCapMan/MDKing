# PR Common-Ground Review (Minimal)

This file is intended to be used as **input to an LLM** to help a code
reviewer and a contributor reach a common ground when a PR improves
performance/robustness but raises concerns about complexity or
maintainability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Input

### 1. Code Diff

Paste the relevant diff here, or link to the PR.

``` diff
# paste diff here
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Problem Before

Briefly explain what was wrong or suboptimal in the original code.

-   What issue existed?
-   Why did it matter? (performance, robustness, correctness, etc.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. What the New Code Fixes

Briefly explain what the new code improves or guarantees.

-   What changed in behavior?
-   What problem is now solved?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Output (to be generated by LLM)

### 4. Trade-off Summary

-   What clear benefits does the change bring?
-   What complexity or maintainability cost is introduced?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. Proposed Common-Ground Solution

Propose **one** of the following, with reasoning:

-   Keep the change as-is and add documentation
-   Refactor to reduce complexity while keeping the benefits
-   Replace with a simpler alternative achieving similar results
-   Reject the change and explain why

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. Concrete Next Actions

List specific, actionable steps.

Examples: - Add comments explaining invariant X - Rename function Y for
clarity - Extract logic Z into a helper - Provide a simpler alternative
implementation
